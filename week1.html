		Bonjour ma famille et mes amis,

My weekly mission emails are back. I think you all know already, but since they stopped, I have been waiting to leave for africa.  I am happy to say that it finally happened and I got to côte d'ivoire last friday.
<br>&ensp;
I had a good send off with my parents and a long trip.  It took me twenty-five hours to get here and it was loads of fun. I met up with eight other elders in Paris and we had a fun time in the airport as well as getting on flights and through customs. Some of the other elders had lost or forgotten important travel documents so some people were very stressed. We got to côte d'ivoire at about 8:00pm friday and went to a hotel for the night.
<br>&ensp;
The first thing that I really noticed was different was the traffic laws. I say that because it seems like there are none, especially as you get farther away from big cities.  People just tend to do what they want here and it's all about who gets their foot in the door first. On the way from the airport I saw street fights and kids bending in between lanes of the road. There was a lot about this country and people that helped me know I am going to like it here. We did training for half the day Saturday and then went to be assigned our companions.
<br>&ensp;
I was paired up with Elder muluba. He is from the congo and doesn't really speak english. The third member of our companionship is Google translate. We were assigned at a stake center where other elders greeted us. I saw both Elder smith (someone I knew from home) and elder Grover (someone I trained with in march of 2020.  A lot of people already knew who I was when i got here which was funny. After that, we took a taxi back to the apartment and ate. When we were done eating Elder muluba and I went out to work.
<br>&ensp;
This is certainly a completely other world than the one I knew so it will take some getting used to.  The only white face that I see in my city is my own reflection. It's kind of an odd feeling. It's not like a place where there is a lot of diversity and white people can be considered a minority, I am literally the only one of a different race here. It's such a cool experience for me and one that I didn't realize would be so intense hahah.  Everyone stares at me and random kids will run up to me and hug me and sing "le blanc le blanc le blanc" (the white the white the white) when I walk by.  It's cute and welcoming.
<br>&ensp;
When we were teaching it was hard because their french and my french are different. We taught a few people and met the bishop who asked me to speak on Sunday, in French of course. I accepted and long story short, Elder muluba and I went home did some study ate and went to bed.
<br>&ensp;
The next morning was sunday and I spoke to the people from the pulpit. I prayed hard so that my words and the sincerity behind them could reach the hearts of the people and I know that they understood me. So many blessings. The first counselor then got up and told them all that I would be great at French in two weeks. Let's hope hes right.
<br>&ensp;
After that, Elder muluba and I went out to our appointments and met with many people. It was a wonderful time and my French was already better than it was that morning.  Often times, Elder muluba will teach and answer questions and I will testify. It's a good dynamic for now, but kn excited for the day when I can really understand this people and share with them the greatest gift that I have in my life. This is the gospel of Jesus Christ. Nothing has given me more comfort, joy, direction, and purpose in my life than this gospel. I spoke to another Elder about why we were serving missions and my short answer was that I had to. I know how much this gospel means to me and what it has given me and I wouldn't feel right if I kept such a wonderful and powerful thing to myself.
<br>&ensp;
I am so glad to be here and although it is hard and it will be perhaps the most difficult thing I ever do, I know that this is where I am supposed to be and that this gospel transforms lives always for the better.
<br>&ensp;
I love you all and wish you the best.

Condiment, Elder McCurdy
