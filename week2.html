                <h1>Elder Mac-Cordy</h1>
                <h4> Week 2 </h4>
                <p>
			&ensp;So i guest ill start with a few funny things that happened this week. First, McCurdy is really difficult for the people to prononce. They end up saying it closer to the true scottish way which sounds like Mac-Cordy. It makes me laugh and im sure all my scottish ancestors love it. Second, There is an ethnic group down here called baoulé and my name according to this people is Konan because i was born on a wednesday. There was a baoulé man who was quite taken with me one day as we were walking. He spoke very fast and with a strong accent. I didnt understand him so i did the only thing i could. I smiled laughed, broke eyecontact and tried to get out of there.  The word ouais (pronounced like way) means "yah" and is kind of a filler word so i just kept saying it and walking.  I then asked Elder Muluba what he was saying and he told me that the man offered me a wife and some animals. How fun.
Someone thought i was a nazi, another person thought i was related to Donald Trump. Definitely a wide varity of expériences to come. 
<br>&ensp;
My stomach settled about a week ago and ive been loving the food. Im eating things and parts of things that i never knew could be eaten before. Its been really nice and im learning to make some of the dishes here, which im excited to bring home with me and make for you guys hahaha. 
<br>&ensp;
We live on the fifth floor of an appartement building and its actually not a bad gig. Across the Street Theres a a placé ive come to call the ûnderground church. Not because its literally ûnderground but because people do meet for church there but it also looks like it could double as a dog fighting ring or something similair in nature. Its actually such an awesome place because whenever i get within a few blocks of my appartement, i can hear the voices of a few hundred people singing their hearts out because of their love for god. This lasts for hours and i love it
<br>&ensp;
Its hard to describe the people here because even in english, my words cannot carry the bepth of meaning that their character deserves. They are a blessed and a spécial people for sure and i am grateful to live among them. Theyre a much simpler people and live well. As i walk around observing them, i see the respect and lack of needless issues in their lives.  They Truly are efficient in where they focus their energy and efforts. The term "first world problems" kept coming to mind as i thought about how different my upbringing was and the problems of the people around me. The first world countries could definitely benifit from learning from this exemple because im sure they could live much happier lives that way.  To me, theyre called first world problems because only places that are wealthy enough can afford to have issues like petty dramas and other things that dont really matter.  I admire the strength and humility of these people so much and learn from them every day. 
<br>&ensp;
I am really beginning to love it here and am so excited to learn the language better and really be able to communicate with the people. Its difficult but most things that are good are difficult. Growth only comes from stretching your capabilities and im only two week in. I love the gospel and the work that i have been called here to do. I pray for each of you and hope you are doing well.

Cordialement, Elder McCurdy
